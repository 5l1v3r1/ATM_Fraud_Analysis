NOT:     ATM theift is a Federal Crime and the Government doesn't like
         there funds fucked with. The author does not, DOES NOT bare 
         responsiblity for the misuse of the information, if you are
         able to commit any of the crimes listed then your able to be

                                 I. CON JOBS


    What is Con? Persuade (someone) to do or believe something by lying 
    to them. All around the world, ATm con artist exists, let's see how 
    these cons are pulled off.


Method 1: THE "DEFECTIVE ATM" CON
=================================

A con method popular with ATMs netted one, scheme works in 
lobbies with more than one ATM, and a service phone. The well dressed and
articulate con man poses as a legit user and stands between two ATMs,
pretending to be talking to the bank service personnel over the service 
phone. After a user inserts his card into the ATMs card reader slot he
tells his that the machine is not working. The user withdraws his card
leaving the ATM activated. Tee con man then observes the user enterring his
PIN into the adjecent ATM. Then, still holding the phone, the con man
enters the users PIN into the first ATM. In make-believe conversation with
the bank, the con man acts like he is receiving instructions from the bank.
To complete the theft he talks the user into entering his card into the 
first ATM again to "test" or "clear" the ATM. He claims that bank personnel 
think that the user's card "locked up" or "jammed" the ATM and or that ATM 
may have made the users card defective, and the insertion of it is required
to "unlock" or "unjam" the ATM and/or to verify that the user's card is 
still vaild. After the users leaves, the con manenters into the keypad
and withdraws the maximum daily amount from the users account.


Method 2. PHONE PIN-EXTRACTION SCAMS
====================================

Another popular con is for the con man to call up an ATM user whose card
he's found or stolen. He identifies himself as a police officer, and 
obtains the PIN from the user by stating that it is required by law to
verify the card owner.
  
  

                                 II. Physical ATM Abuse
  
  

Method 1: SUPER COLD GASES
==========================

Liquid nitrogen can be used. It is simply poured onto or into the offending part 
of the ATM and when it hits 100 degrees or so, a sledge or  a ballpeen hammer is 
smartyl slammedin to. The metal SHOULD shatter like glass. Then one just simply
reaches in and examines the untold riches stored inside. Super-cooled gases can 
also wreck havoc on electronics, cameras and films, and bullet-proof glass,
and can be purchased from suppliers of medical and chemical supplies.


Method 2: WATER & ICE
=======================

We have also herd that pouring warm water into an isolated  ATM on a very cold 
night is effective. When water freezes, it expands with a terrific force, 
and will shatter or tear apart anything made by man. The water is  poured or pumped
in thru the card slot or cash dispenser. It is heavily  mixed with wood shavings
or fiberglass to stop-up any drainage hole in the  ATM. Leaks can also be plugged
up with window putty or bubble gum.


Method 3: MORE FREEZE METHODS
==============================

ATMs use ACE locks (the ones found on most vending machines, the circle type lock) 
Freon works on these locks. Somw outlaws empty a can of freon into an ATM lock, 
pound a screwdriver into the key way, and wrench the lock out,  motor-driven ACE 
lock pick will vibrate pins into the right positions withine a few minutes.

Method 4: ACETYLENE & DRILLS
============================

ATMs are notorisly vulnerable to attacks using acetylene torches  with most ATMs no
more than 5 minutes are required for the entire job.




                                III. ELECTRONIC & COMPUTER SCAMS



METHOD 1: THE WIRETAP
======================

"Tapping" or "wiretapping" consists of the unauthorized electronic monitering
of a signal (voice or digital) transmitted over a phone or computer (commo)
circuit. A "tap" is the monitoring device that does this. Athough a tap is
usually placed somewhere on a phoneline or junction box, it may be placed
inside of a phone, modem or computer. With the advent of isolated stand-alone
ATMs (with vulnerable phone lines, including POS terminals) and computer 
technology. The phone circuits that  connect ATMs to their host computer 
(located in the banks data processing center) can be tapped anywhere between the two.


METHOD 2: THE WIRELESS WIRETAP
===============================

An "invasive tap" is one in which a hard electronic connection is made between the
tap and the commo circuit. A "non-invasive" tap is one  in which an induction loop
or antenna is used to pick up the EMI generated by the signal, and there is no 
physical connection between the commo circuit and the line. A "passive tap" is
one in which the tap simply tramits to a recorder or  directly records the tapped 
signal and in no way interfers with it. An "active tap" is one in which the tap
ALSO interferes (changes,adds to or deletes) the tapped signal in some way. 
Active taps are more sophisted. A typical ATM active tap is one that records a
signal, the later plays it back over the line.


METHOD 3: NFC RELAY AND PROXY
===============================

This one works in NFC ENABLED CREDIT/DEBIT cards. One end will relay requests  directly
to a credit card. The other end will proxy a reader's requests over WiFi to the relay 
end. NFC Proxy exactly does that.





                                        IV. Physical Frauds




METHOD 1: ATM SKIMMER
======================

The typical ATM skimmer is a small device that fits over an existing card reader.  
Most of the time, the attackers will also place a hidden camera somewhere in the 
vicinity in order to record personal identification numbers, or PINs, used to access accounts.
That's the skimmer.


METHOD 2: AUDIO SKIMMER
========================

Analog ATM skimmer attached with Audio to capture credit and debit card data, an
increasingly popular credit card reader built for the iPhone, works by plugging into the headphone 
jack on the iPhone and converting credit card data stored on the card into audio files.


METHOD 3: 3D Printers
======================

Fraudsters using 3D-Printer technology to build themselve low cost ATM skimmers, 
for all purpose.






                                           V. Classic Telephone Hacking



METHOD 1: WarDialing
======================

Fraudsters use War Dialing for all sorts of purpose via Landline, GSM or CDMA based telephones,
War dailer is intelligent software that identifies if one telephone bell is used and 
remote party picked up by automated operator.


METHOD 2: Voltage Dropping Method
==================================

When a telephone is picked up, the line voltage drops from 48 Volts to between 9 and 3 Volts, 
depending on the length of the loop. 


METHOD 3: Modem Remote Command
==================================

Phreakers/Hacker's use this method to tell ATM modem to do certain type of action, that could be
direct access into Hyper Terminal or any other related software or call back or anything, 
War Dailer's use Modem Ping Back, it is ping to confirm if remote machine is active and on.





                                      VI. Identify and Capture Frauds




METHOD 1: Radio Frequency Hack
================================

I found is to turn on Mobile Phone's FM Radio Module and try to make a close contact 
with ATM skimmer, Keyboard/Slot Area. Because of the battery ION'S being discharge,
you will hear very different kind of sound via Radio Module.


METHOD 2: Nickel Radio Frequency 
=================================

I found, get yourself a pure nickel coin (a silvery-white metal, the chemical element 
of atomic number 28 in chemistry) and try to rub that near possible skimmer area, 
turn on your Mobile Phone's Radio Module, you will hear different sounds when you rub
nickel against close contact battery of skimmer, another possible infacted ATM to avoid.

 Final Words
 ============

I did my best to teach and make aware of ATM possible fraud, author alone and do not represent the 
views of the possible fraud and catching metholody, nor take any sort of accpetance, what you do after reading
this material.
