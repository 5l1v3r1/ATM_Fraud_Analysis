                                 I. CON JOBS


    What is Con? Persuade (someone) to do or believe something by lying 
    to them. All around the world, ATm con artist exists, let's see how 
    these cons are pulled off.

Method 1: THE "DEFECTIVE ATM" CON

A con method popular with ATMs netted one, scheme works in 
lobbies with more than one ATM, and a service phone. The well dressed and
articulate con man poses as a legit user and stands between two ATMs,
pretending to be talking to the bank service personnel over the service 
phone. After a user inserts his card into the ATMs card reader slot he
tells his that the machine is not working. The user withdraws his card
leaving the ATM activated. Tee con man then observes the user enterring his
PIN into the adjecent ATM. Then, still holding the phone, the con man
enters the users PIN into the first ATM. In make-believe conversation with
the bank, the con man acts like he is receiving instructions from the bank.
To complete the theft he talks the user into entering his card into the 
first ATM again to "test" or "clear" the ATM. He claims that bank personnel 
think that the user's card "locked up" or "jammed" the ATM and or that ATM 
may have made the users card defective, and the insertion of it is required
to "unlock" or "unjam" the ATM and/or to verify that the user's card is 
still vaild. After the users leaves, the con manenters into the keypad
and withdraws the maximum daily amount from the users account.

Method 2. PHONE PIN-EXTRACTION SCAMS
  Another popular con is for the con man to call up an ATM user whose card
he's found or stolen. He identifies himself as a police officer, and 
obtains the PIN from the user by stating that it is required by law to
verify the card owner. This works really well if you can bullshit them
good like act like you have to do something and tell them to call you
right back. 
  
  

                                    II. Physical Abuse
  
  

Method 1: SUPER COLD GASES
==========================

                           Liquid nitrogen can be used. It is simply poured onto or
into the offending part of the ATM and when it hits 100 degrees or so, a sledge or 
a ballpeen hammer is smartyl slammedin to. The metal SHOULD shatter like glass. Then
one just simply reaches in and examines the untold riches stored inside.
Super-cooled gases can also wreck havoc on electronics, cameras and films,
and bullet-proof glass, and can be purchased from suppliers of medical and
chemical supplies.


Method 2: WATER & ICE
=======================

                          We have also herd that pouring warm water into an isolated 
ATM on a very cold night is effective. When water freezes, it expands with a terrific
force, and will shatter or tear apart anything made by man. The water is 
poured or pumped in thru the card slot or cash dispenser. It is heavily 
mixed with wood shavings or fiberglass to stop-up any drainage hole in the 
ATM. Leaks can also be plugged up with window putty or bubble gum.


Method 3: MORE FREEZE METHODS
==============================

                              ATMs use ACE locks (the ones found on most vending machines,
the circle type lock) Freon works on these locks. Somw outlaws empty a can of freon
into an ATM lock, pound a screwdriver into the key way, and wrench the lock out, 
motor-driven ACE lock pick will vibrate pins into the right positions withine a few minutes.

Method 4: ACETYLENE & DRILLS
============================

                            ATMs are notorisly vulnerable to attacks using acetylene torches 
with most ATMs no more than 5 minutes are required for the entire job.


III. ELECTRONIC & COMPUTER SCAMS

METHOD 1: THE WIRETAP
======================

                       "Tapping" or "wiretapping" consists of the unauthorized
electronic monitering of a signal (voice or digital) transmitted over a phone or
computer (commo) circuit. A "tap" is the monitoring device that does this.
Athough a tap is usually placed somewhere on a phoneline or junction box,
it may be placed inside of a phone, modem or computer.
 With the advent of isolated stand-alone ATMs (with vulnerable phone lines,
including POS terminals) and computer technology. The phone circuits that 
connect ATMs to their host computer (located in the banks data processing
center) can be tapped anywhere between the two.


METHOD 2: THE WIRELESS WIRETAP
===============================

                                An "invasive tap" is one in which a hard electronic
connection is made between the tap and the commo circuit. A "non-invasive" tap is one 
in which an induction loop or antenna is used to pick up the EMI generated by the
signal, and there is no physical connection between the commo circuit and
the line. A "passive tap" is one in which the tap simply tramits to a recorder or 
directly records the tapped signal and in no way interfers with it. An
"active tap" is one in which the tap ALSO interferes (changes,adds to or
deletes) the tapped signal in some way. Active taps are more sophisted. A
typical ATM active tap is one that records a signal, the later plays it
back over the line.




                                    III. Electronic & Computer Scams


METHOD 1: NFC RELAY AND PROXY
===============================

                                  This one works in NFC ENABLED CREDIT/DEBIT cards. One end will relay requests 
 directly to a credit card. The other end will proxy a reader's requests over WiFi 
 to the relay end. NFC Proxy exactly does that.



III. Physical Frauds

METHOD 1: ATM SKIMMER
======================

                        The typical ATM skimmer is a small device that fits over an existing card reader. 
Most of the time, the attackers will also place a hidden camera somewhere in the 
vicinity in order to record personal identification numbers, or PINs, used to access accounts.
That's the skimmer.

METHOD 2: AUDIO SKIMMER
========================

                        Analog ATM skimmer attached with Audio to capture credit and debit card data, 
an increasingly popular credit card reader built for the iPhone, works by plugging into the headphone 
jack on the iPhone and converting credit card data stored on the card into audio files.


METHOD 3: 3D Printers
======================

                       Fraudsters using 3D-Printer technology to build themselve low cost ATM skimmers, 
for all purpose.





                                    III. Author Note

Catpuring these Fraudsters
===========================

1. How to capture these frauds, can be tricky, but I found the most common way, is to turn on your Mobile
Phone's FM Radio Module and try to make a close contact with ATM skimmer, Keyboard/Slot Area. Because of
the battery used in ATM skimmer, you will hear some different kind of sound via Radio Module.

2. Another method I found, get yourself a pure nickel coin (a silvery-white metal, the chemical element 
of atomic number 28 in chemistry) and try to rub that near skimmer area that would be Keyboard/Slot Area,
and turn on Mobile Phone's Radio Module, you will hear crazy sounds or probably more bandwidth (heavy/dark)
sounds, another possible infacted ATM to avoid.

 Final Words
 ============

I did my best to teach and make aware of ATM possible fraud, author alone and do not represent the 
views of the possible fraud and catching metholody, nor take any sort of accpetance, what you do after reading
this material.
